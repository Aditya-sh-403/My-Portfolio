      <h1>Bharti Airtel Limited - 15/06/2023 to 16/07/2023</h1>
      <p>
        During my one-month internship at Airtel as an Electronics and
        Telecommunication Intern, I immersed myself in a dynamic and fast-paced
        environment that deepened my understanding of the telecom industry. My
        role involved working closely with the network operations team to
        monitor and optimize network performance. I was tasked with analyzing
        data from various network nodes, identifying potential issues, and
        proposing solutions to enhance service quality. Additionally, I assisted
        in the deployment and testing of new equipment, gaining hands-on
        experience with advanced telecommunication technologies. <br />

        One of the highlights of my internship was participating in a project
        aimed at improving network coverage in underserved areas. This involved
        collaborating with engineers to assess field data and implement
        adjustments to the network infrastructure. The experience sharpened my
        problem-solving skills and provided insight into the strategic
        decision-making processes behind network expansion and maintenance.
        <br />

        Throughout the month, I had the opportunity to attend team meetings,
        contribute to brainstorming sessions, and engage with professionals who
        offered valuable mentorship and feedback. Overall, the internship at
        Airtel was an enriching experience that enhanced my technical skills,
        offered practical industry insights, and ignited a deeper passion for
        the field of telecommunications.

      <h1>Accenture - 07/01/2024 to 09/04/2024</h1>
      <p>
        During my three-month internship at Accenture as a Frontend Developer, I
        had the opportunity to dive into the world of cutting-edge technology
        and innovative solutions. My role primarily involved collaborating with
        a team of developers to design, develop, and refine user interfaces for
        a variety of client projects. I worked extensively with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, contributing to the development of responsive and visually
        appealing web applications. <br />

        One of my key responsibilities was to implement UI/UX designs provided
        by the design team, ensuring that they were not only aesthetically
        pleasing but also functionally efficient across different devices and
        browsers. I gained hands-on experience with modern frontend frameworks
        like React and Angular, which allowed me to build scalable and
        maintainable components. <br />

        A significant project I worked on involved optimizing a clientâ€™s
        e-commerce platform, where I was tasked with improving page load times
        and enhancing user interaction. This project honed my skills in
        performance tuning and problem-solving. <br />

        Throughout the internship, I participated in regular code reviews, agile
        sprints, and team meetings, which provided me with valuable feedback and
        a deeper understanding of industry best practices. The experience at
        Accenture was incredibly rewarding, equipping me with practical skills
        and a solid foundation in frontend development.
